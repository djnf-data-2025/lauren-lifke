A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work immediately at the internship. 

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:

Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this analysis on name, image and likeness trends: https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this analysis of environment spill data: https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election data: https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/


Here's what your newsroom suggested for a project

Some General Information regarding contributions, transfers and loans.		
		
A contribution is money or anything of value given to a political committee to promote or assist in promoting the success or defeat of a candidate, political party, or question. A contribution can be made by any individual or by an entity, including a corporation or other business entity, a political club, a federal committee, or a labor union.		
		
		
A transfer is a monetary contribution made by one political committee  to another. For example: a PAC may transfer money to a candidate committee. In addition, the law allows an out-of-state political committee to transfer money to a Maryland political committee if the out-of-state committee is properly registered with its own state’s election authority. Federal committees are not considered out-of-state political committees and therefore cannot make transfers but can make contributions. 		
		
		
		
A loan is a permissible way for a campaign to receive funds. There is no limit on the amount of money that can be loaned to the campaign. However, unless the loan is executed properly and paid off in a timely manner, the loan will be converted into a contribution.		
		
		
		
		
A person may contribute directly or indirectly no more than $6,000 to one political committee, and a total of $24,000 to all political committees, during the four-year cycle.		
		
		
The $6,000 limit on contributions to the political committee of a candidate applies regardless of the number of offices sought by the candidate in separate elections during the 4 year election cycle or the number of authorized candidate committees formed to support the candidate, including slates.		
		
		
A  political committee may transfer no more than $6,000 to another political committee during the four (4) year cycle.  There is no aggregate limit.

Ans. Generally, Maryland campaign funds are for State candidates. However, it is permissible for a State campaign finance entity to make expenditures to support a federal candidate or federal PAC.

Que. For every credit card contribution, a fee is assessed for the transaction. How should this be reported?		
Ans. A person makes a credit card contribution of $100 to a candidate committee. The candidate committee hired a service to process the transaction. The hired service charges 1% on the amount per transaction. The candidate committee reports receiving a contribution of $100 from the person and also reports making an expenditure of $1 to the hired service. It is not necessary to make the expenditures for every transaction but the cumulative total weekly or monthly depending on how the committee is billed.

Que. Can I close my authorized candidate campaign committee while I'm still on the ballot?		
Ans. No, the candidate committee must remain active and open during the election. If you lose in the primary election, you may close your committee with the first report due AFTER the Primary election. You may not close your committee prior to the Primary election if you are an active candidate on the Primary election ballot.		
		
		
Independent Expenditures and Participating Organizations		
Que. If an out-of_State political committee makes independent expenditures must it file independent expenditures reports?

Que. Does a federal political committee need to register as a participating organization and file disbursement reports if it makes a contribution to a Maryland candidate?		
Ans. Yes, If a federal political committee makes a contribution of $6,000 or more to a Maryland candidate, the federal committee needs to register as a participating organization. If the federal committee makes aggregate disbursements of $10,000 or more in an election cycle, it is required to file a report of all disbursements made to influence elections in Maryland.
